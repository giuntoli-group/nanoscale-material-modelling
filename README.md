## Kickoff assignment

Please follow [this link](https://github.com/giuntoli-group/init-project) for the fundamental technical knowledge you need for the course. You will find more information on the command line, connection to Habrok, and how to run your first simulation. For now, focus on Part 1 and before that make sure you have a Habrok account. If you don't, go to Habrok [documentation](https://wiki.hpc.rug.nl/habrok/introduction/policies) and follow the steps to request one with your S-number.
